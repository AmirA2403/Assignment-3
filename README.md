First, we use the authenticate() function to verify that a valid username is entered before proceeding to the quiz page. If the username is entered correctly, the quiz section (quizContainer) is displayed by modifying the DOM elements. The progress bar (progressBar) is implemented using the updateProgressBar() function, which is called each time an answer is selected. This function uses an event listener (change event on the form) to track the number of questions answered in real-time.
During quiz submission, the submitQuiz() function evaluates the user's responses for correctness by comparing the selected options with the correct answers stored in the answers constant. Correct answers are highlighted in green using CSS classes (correct), while incorrect answers are marked in red (incorrect). Additionally, the correct answers are always highlighted in green, even if not selected by the user, using variables like correctOption and correctLabel to target the appropriate elements. Finally, the result text (resultText) is updated to display the user's score based on the number of correct answers.
